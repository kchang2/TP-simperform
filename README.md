# Team and Player Simularity Score Calculator (Baseball)

Written for the AY119 course project at Caltech, in order to investigate a topic of choice using computational science tools gained from the course.
Modified from Ryan Pollack's Team simularity score (ryanpollack.com), and Bill James Similarity Scores method.

### Requirements:
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn
- Lahman's Baseball Database CSV format

### Features:
+ Includes new derived metrics for pitchers and for hitters.
+ Includes visualization tools.
